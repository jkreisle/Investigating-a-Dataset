## Objective

Find a baseball statistic that best predicts how many wins a team will earn in a given season.

###Skills applied

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn

## Summary

I explored a baseball dataset that contained 48 team and player statistics. 

Used Python packages to:

    1) Read in csv file

    2) Chart distribution of data

    3) Find correlation between variables

## Findings

Wins in baseball do not result from one statistic, but many. A team must perform well both offensively and defensively to earn wins.
